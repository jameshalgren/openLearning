  - " ... human constructions have a limited life cycle and need good management, maintenance, adaptation to changing conditions and, at times, replacement. IIn this respect, planning and design of engineering infrastructures are not once-and-for-all actions but perpetual processes."
  - "While soft-path low-cost means, like public awareness building and flood warning systems, are pertinent for mitigation of the flood risk (Di Baldassare et al. 2010), engineering means (including structural solutions and urban planning) remain the most powerful weapon in flood protection."
  - "Rather, the primary target depends on the pragmatic objectives of the problem which we study (cf. Littlewood (2010), who compares utility versus process understanding and Rosbjerg & Madsen (2005), who suggest that the development or selection of a model should reflect the actual needs for modelling results)... the spatially distributed information provided by [physically based] approaches may be misleading or even wrong if it is not controlled through real world data, which provide the final judge for the entire modelling exercise."
  - "A characteristic effect of this misleading approach (detailed physically-based modelling in a hopeless attemptto achieve a correct understanding and produce analytical and insightful calculations of the detailed dynamics at the finest scales) is that most hydrological models are for natural (intact) conditions, while most of the catchments have been modified by humans. In modified catchments it is misleading to study the hydrological behaviour independently of their management or even in a serial approach where a management model is fed by the outputs of a hydrological model. A more consistent approach would admit a two way interaction of hydrological processes and management practices (Nalbantis et al. 2011)."
